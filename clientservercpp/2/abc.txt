1.Write two C++ programs in Unix/Linux environment. a. shm1.cpp will allocate a shared memory segment that contains an integer variable and set it to 1,000,000 initially. After that, it will constantly check the integer from the shared memory segment. Once it becomes 2,000,000, it prints out the value 2,000,000 on the console, removes the shared memory segment, and then terminate b. shm2.cpp will read the integer variable 1,000,000 from the shared memory segment, prints the integer on the console, increase it by 1,000,000, and then save the variableâ€™s value 2,000,000 into the shared memory segment, and then terminate itself. 
2. Write two C++ programs in Unix/Linux environment: Sender.cpp and Receiver.cpp. Both will have a file name as a command-line argument. Sender.cpp will use message queues to send the contents of the file to Receiver.cpp. Receiver.cpp will record the contents into the file whose name is its command-line argument. Sender and Receiver will terminate when they have completed their tasks.
